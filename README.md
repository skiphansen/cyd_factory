# What is this

This repo contains the mostly unmodified support files for various 
Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) board I've been playing with.  I'm primarily
interested in the demo programs.

## Why

I had a hard time finding the support files since many are only available
upon request via wechat or the provided links were dead or unusable from
outside of China.

Additionally I use platformio **NOT** the Arduino GUI for various reasons
so I've added Platformio support to the demo's I've compiled.  I've also
converted some .ino files into .cpp files for my personal convenience.
